							<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>What Is Asthma?</strong></p>
							<p>Asthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. 
							Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath,
							and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.
							Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. 
							In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7 million of these people are children.
						</p>
						<h2>Need To Aware About Asthma</h2>
						<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>To understand asthma</strong> </p>
							<p>It helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs.
							People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive.
							The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances.
							When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. 
							This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. 
							The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. 
							Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.
							This chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed.</p>
						<h2>Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
						<h3>Asthma symptoms can differ for each person, but here are some of the most common:</h3>
						<p><strong>
						1)Wheezing:</strong></p>
						<p>You may notice a wheezing sound when you breathe. Sometimes this happens only when you exercise or have a cold.</p> 
						<p><strong>
						2)Frequent Cough:</strong></p> 
						<p>This may be more common at night. You may or may not cough up mucus.</p> 
						<p><strong>
						3)Shortness of Breath: </strong></p>
						<p>This is the feeling you can’t get enough air into your lungs. It may occur only once in a while, or often.</p> 
						<p><strong>
						4)Chest Tightness:</strong></p>
						Your chest may feel tight, especially during cold weather or exercise. This can also be the first sign of a flare-up. 
						Talk to your healthcare provider if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. The sooner you begin treating your asthma and maintaining control, the less damage you will cause to your lungs in the long run. There are many resources available for people living with asthma and their loved ones

				<h2>What Causes Asthma Symptoms?</h2>
<p>For people with asthma, respiratory infections, allergens, chemicals, odors, physical activity, emotions, seasonal changes and smoking can irritate the lungs. We call these triggers because they cause (trigger) changes in the airways. Understanding the things that trigger your asthma will help you manage your disease. Work with your healthcare provider to help find the triggers that cause your asthma symptoms. Once you have identified the triggers that cause your asthma symptoms, work on ways to avoid the trigger entirely or limit your exposure to it.</p>

<h2>How is Asthma Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>
If you experience any of the symptoms above, it is important to see your healthcare provider to determine if you have asthma. You will be asked for some medical history, which should include family members with asthma, smoking, allergies, and exposure to pollutants in your workplace. You will also get a physical exam. There are also several breathing tests your healthcare provider may perform. The most common test is called spirometry. (Spirometry uses a device called, a spirometer, to measure the amount and speed of the air you blow out.) This will help your healthcare provider to see how well your lungs are working. There are other lung diseases that may cause some of the same symptoms as asthma. If your doctor thinks you might have something else, he or she may order additional tests.</p>
<h2>Asthma Treatment</h2>
<p>Once your healthcare provider makes a diagnosis of asthma, you will be prescribed medicines to help control your asthma. Medicines prescribed to treat your asthma may seem difficult to understand and difficult to use. It is important that you work with your healthcare provider on an asthma action plan designed specifically for your needs. An asthma action plan provides key information on when to take your medicines on a daily basis and what to do in an emergency. This will help you take control of your asthma so you can live a healthy and productive life.</p>

<!--FDA believes that disease awareness communications can provide important health information to consumers and health care practitioners, and can encourage consumers to seek, and health care practitioners to provide, appropriate treatment. This is particularly important for under-diagnosed, under-treated health conditions, such as depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Unlike drug and device promotional labeling and prescription drug and restricted device advertising, disease awareness communications are not subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations.

						<p class="under">Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark have developed ten new antibodies that can be used in the battle against cancer. These antibodies work by inhibiting the body's blood vessel formation close to the tumour which is, thereby, cut off from oxygen and nutrient supply. In lab tests over mice, the team have succeeded in using these antibodies to stop the development of malignant tumours.

						 <p  class="under">An electronic nose can be used to successfully detect different sub-groups of asthmatic children and help tailor treatment to suit each person, according to a new study. 

						Healthcare professionals now understand that there are many different types of asthma and that it affects people in very different ways, researchers said.

						Current research efforts are focused on categorizing these different clusters into phenotypes and on revealing underlying pathophysiological pathways of these smaller sub groups of asthma.

						If this can be achieved, it will help healthcare professionals tailor asthma treatment to suit each person, rather than a 'one size fits all' approach, researchers said.
