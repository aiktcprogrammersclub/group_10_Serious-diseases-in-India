						Cancer of lip and oral cavity has emerged as the deadliest among Indian men while for women, it is breast cancer.
						The global cancer burden jumped to 14.1 million new cases in 2012, with WHO saying the marked increase in breast

							<p> 1)The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), WHO's specialized cancer agency, 
								has released the latest data on cancer incidence, mortality and prevalence worldwide.</p> 

							<p> 2)The new version of IARC's GLOBOCAN 2012 provides the most recent estimates for 28 types of cancer in 184 countries and 
							offers a comprehensive overview of the global cancer burden.</p> 
							
							<p> 3)It reveals striking patterns of cancer in women and highlights that priority 
							should be given to cancer prevention and control measures for breast and cervical cancers globally.</p> 

							<p> 4)According to GLOBOCAN 2012, an estimated 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths occurred in 2012, 
							compared with 12.7 million and 7.6 million, respectively, in 2008. </p>

							<p> 5)Prevalence estimates for 2012 show there were 32.6 million people (over the age of 15 years) 
							alive who had had a cancer diagnosed in the previous five years.</p> 

							<p> 6)The most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide were those of the lung (1.8 million, 13% of the total), 
							breast (1.7 million, 11.9%), and colorectum (1.4 million, 9.7%).</p>
							 
							 <p> 7)The most common causes of cancer death were cancers of the lung (1.6 million, 19.4% of the total), 
							 liver (0.8 million, 9.1%),and stomach (0.7 million, 8.8%).</p> 

							<p> 8)Projections based on GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025, 
							due to growth and ageing of the global population. More than half of all cancers (56.8%) and 
							cancer deaths (64.9%) in 2012 occurred in less developed regions of the world, and these proportions will 
							increase further by 2025.</p> 

							<p> 9)In 2012, 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and there were 6.3 million women 
							alive who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous five years.</p> 
							
							<p> 10)Since the 2008 estimates, breast cancer incidence has increased by more than 20%, while mortality has increased by 14%.</p> 
							
							<p>11)Breast cancer is also the most common cause of cancer death among women (522,000 deaths in 2012) and 
							the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in 140 of 184 countries.</p> 
							
							<p>12)It now represents one in four of all cancers in women.</p>

							 head of the IARC Section of Cancer Information, the group that compiles the global cancer data.</p>
							 
							 <p>14)"This is partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances

				<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>Defination :</strong></p>
				<p>Cancers are a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.
				They form a subset of neoplasms. 
				A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth,
				and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.</p>
				<p class="pad_bot1"><Strong>Short Introduction</strong></p>

					Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by out-of-control cell growth.
					 There are over 100 different types of cancer, and each is classified by the type of cell that is initially affected.

					Cancer harms the body when damaged cells divide uncontrollably to form lumps or masses of tissue called tumors 
					(except in the case of leukemia where cancer prohibits normal blood function by abnormal cell division in the blood stream).
					 Tumors can grow and interfere with the digestive, nervous, and circulatory systems, and they can release hormones that alter body function. 
					 Tumors that stay in one spot and demonstrate limited growth are generally considered to be benign.</p>

<p><Strong>More dangerous, or malignant, tumors form when two things occur:</strong></p>

   <p> 1)A cancerous cell manages to move throughout the body using the blood or lymph systems, destroying healthy tissue in a process called invasion
    that cell manages to divide and grow, making new blood vessels to feed itself in a process called angiogenesis.</p>

	<p>When a tumor successfully spreads to other parts of the body and grows, invading and destroying other healthy tissues, 
	it is said to have metastasized. This process itself is called metastasis, and the result is a serious condition that is very difficult to treat.</p> 



				<strong>Six characteristics of cancer have been proposed:</strong>
					<p>self-sufficiency in growth signalling.</p>
					<p>insensitivity to anti-growth signals</p>
					<p>evasion of apoptosis.</p>
					<p>enabling of a limitless replicative potential</p>
					<p>induction and sustainment of angiogenesis<p>
					<p>activation of metastasis and invasion of tissue.</p>
				<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>What causes cancer?</strong></p>

			<p>Cancer is ultimately the result of cells that uncontrollably grow and do not die. 
			Normal cells in the body follow an orderly path of growth, division, and death. 
			Programmed cell death is called apoptosis, and when this process breaks down, cancer begins to form. 
			Unlike regular cells, cancer cells do not experience programmatic death and instead continue to grow and divide.
			This leads to a mass of abnormal cells that grows out of control.</p>
			<strong>Cancer prevention: 7 tips to reduce your risk</strong>
			<p>You've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. 
			Sometimes the specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study or news report is advised against in another. 
			In many cases, what is known about cancer prevention is still evolving. 
			However, it's well accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make. 
			So if you're concerned about cancer prevention, take comfort in the fact that some simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference.
			Consider these seven cancer prevention tips. </p>

			<p><strong>Cancer Symptoms Men Ignore<strong></p>
							<strong>1. Problems When You Pee</strong>
				<p>Many men have some problems peeing as they get older, like
				A need to pee more often, especially at night
				Dribbling, leaking, or an urgent need to go
				Trouble starting to pee, or a weak stream
				An enlarged prostate gland usually causes these symptoms, but so can prostate cancer.
				 See your doctor to check on the cause of the problem. He’ll give you an exam to look for an enlarged prostate,
				 and he may talk to you about a blood test (called a PSA test) for prostate cancer.</p>

				<strong>2. Changes in Your Testicles</strong>
				<p>"If you notice a lump, heaviness, or any other change in your testicle, never delay having it looked at," says Herbert Lepor,
				 MD, urology chairman at New York University Langone Medical Center. "Unlike prostate cancer, which grows slowly, 
				 testicular cancer can take off overnight." Your doctor will look for any problems with a physical exam, blood tests, and an ultrasound
				 of your scrotum.</p>

				<strong>3. Blood in Your Pee or Stool</strong>
				<p>These can be among the first signs of cancer of the bladder, kidneys, or colon.
				 It's a good idea to see your doctor for any bleeding that’s not normal, even if you don't have other symptoms, 
				 Lepor says. Although you're more likely to have a problem that's not cancer, like hemorrhoids or a urinary infection, 
				 it's important to find and treat the cause.</p>

<!--FDA believes that disease awareness communications can provide important health information to consumers and health care practitioners, and can encourage consumers to seek, and health care practitioners to provide, appropriate treatment. This is particularly important for under-diagnosed, under-treated health conditions, such as depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Unlike drug and device promotional labeling and prescription drug and restricted device advertising, disease awareness communications are not subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations.
