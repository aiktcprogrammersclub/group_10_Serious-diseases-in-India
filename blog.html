							<b>We’ve made a lot of progress in detection and treatment for many types of cancer, but it still can be a frightening diagnosis.

								<p>
								I started smoking when I was 16 years old. I eventually smoked 20­30 cigarettes a day.

								I definitely noticed a difference...

								...with my asthma when I stopped ­ I was able to go for a run (short distances) with my dog and I

								had a personal trainer three times a week to lose weight, which I would never have been able to do

								before. I'm also glad I quit because now my clothes are fresh and clean, my car doesn't smell, and I

								have more money in the bank!

								How I did it

								I stopped with the help of stop smoking classes over five years ago, along with tablets and

								willpower. I did have a slight blip, and I still get cravings once in a blue moon, but the cravings

								don't last long. I normally get up and do something even if it's putting some stuff away in the

								house, or picking up a book and reading a few lines, then the craving goes. Initially I felt I had

								nothing to do with my hands so I got my mum to show me how to knit: my fingers and

								concentration were kept busy and I forgot about smoking as I wanted to learn something new. I

								would recommend quitting to anyone.</p>
