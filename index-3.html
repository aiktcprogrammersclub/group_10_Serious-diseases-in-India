							<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>Diabetes</strong></p>
							<p>Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases 
							in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, 
							or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will 
							typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia).
						</p>
						</div>
						<h2>Fast Facts On Diabetes</h2>
						<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>To understand Diabetes</strong> </p>
							<p>Here are some key points about diabetes. More detail and supporting information is in the main article.</p>
							<p>• Diabetes is a long-term condition that causes high blood sugar levels.</p>
							<p>•In 2013 it was estimated that over 382 million people throughout the world had diabetes 
								(Williams textbook of endocrinology).</p>
							<p>•	Type 1 Diabetes - the body does not produce insulin. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.</p>
							<p>	•	Type 2 Diabetes - the body does not produce enough insulin for proper function. 
								Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are of this type.</p>
							<p>	•	Gestational Diabetes - this type affects females during pregnancy.</p>
							<p>	•	The most common diabetes symptoms include frequent urination, intense thirst and hunger,
								weight gain, unusual weight loss, fatigue, cuts and bruises that do not heal, male sexual dysfunction,
								numbness and tingling in hands and feet.</p>
							<p>	•	If you have Type 1 and follow a healthy eating plan, do adequate exercise, and take insulin, you can lead a normal life.</p>
							<p>	•	Type 2 patients need to eat healthily, be physically active, and test their blood glucose. 
								They may also need to take oral medication, and/or insulin to control blood glucose levels.</p>
							<p>	•	As the risk of cardiovascular disease is much higher for a diabetic, it is crucial that blood pressure
								and cholesterol levels are monitored regularly.</p>
							<p>	•	As smoking might have a serious effect on cardiovascular health, diabetics should stop smoking.</p>
							<p>	•	Hypoglycemia - low blood glucose - can have a bad effect on the patient.
								Hyperglycemia - when blood glucose is too high - can also have a bad effect on the patient.</p>


														
							<p class="pad_bot1"><strong>There are three types of diabetes:</strong></p>
									<p><strong>1) Type 1 Diabetes</strong>
									The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.
									Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.
									Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.
									Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according toSEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). (Link to article)
									<p><strong>2) Type 2 Diabetes</strong>
									The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).
									Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are of this type.
									 Measuring the glucose level in blood
									Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.
									Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.
									Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.
									The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.
									Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. (Link to article)
									<p><strong>3) Gestational Diabetes</strong>
									<p>This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.
									Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.
									The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. 
									Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications.
									Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. 
									The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.
									Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets
									before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes,
									compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats. (Link to article)</p>

<!--FDA believes that disease awareness communications can provide important health information to consumers and health care practitioners, and can encourage consumers to seek, and health care practitioners to provide, appropriate treatment. This is particularly important for under-diagnosed, under-treated health conditions, such as depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Unlike drug and device promotional labeling and prescription drug and restricted device advertising, disease awareness communications are not subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations.

						<strong>Smart insulin' shows promise in mice with

type 1 diabetes</strong>
						<p class="under">The researchers are now developing the smart insulin into a therapy suitable for human use.

								They anticipate it being ready for clinical trials in 2­5 years.

								Tests on mice with a form of type 1 diabetes showed that one injection of Ins­PBA­F works for at

								least 14 hours. During this period, the smart insulin activated several times in response to blood

								sugar rising after the mice were given amounts of sugar comparable to that consumed at

								mealtimes.</p>

						 <p  class="under">An electronic nose can be used to successfully detect different sub-groups of asthmatic children and help tailor treatment to suit each person, according to a new study. 

						Healthcare professionals now understand that there are many different types of asthma and that it affects people in very different ways, researchers said.

						Current research efforts are focused on categorizing these different clusters into phenotypes and on revealing underlying pathophysiological pathways of these smaller sub groups of asthma.

						If this can be achieved, it will help healthcare professionals tailor asthma treatment to suit each person, rather than a 'one size fits all' approach, researchers said.
